Reviewing /Collisions/CollisionManager.cs created by Jack Italiano

General comments:
-   Great use of comments throughout. Makes reading code much easier. Especially
    considering how convoluted collisions can be. Parts that are uncommented
    make use of clean code and good variable names to increase readability.
-   Like the use of the generic "IGameObject," makes implementing collisions on
    future interfaces much more doable.

Suggestion:
-   Nothing in particular! The functionality is all there. However time will
    tell on the long term functionality as we add more collisions to the game.
