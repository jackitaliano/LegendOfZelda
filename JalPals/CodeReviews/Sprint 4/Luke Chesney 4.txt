Sprint 4

Reviewing /Sound/SoundManager.cs created by Alton Burkholder

General comments:
-   Great use of comments throughout. Makes reading code much easier.
-   Makes use of sound much simpler!
-   Nice utility methods.

Suggestion:
-   I would suggest adding a pause function. For example, when the game ends,
    there is different game over music. Something to work on for next sprint!
-   I also think it would be a nice feature to have the sounds auto-populate.
    Sorta like how the CSVs auto populate. Theres probably some drawbacks to
    this approach too.
