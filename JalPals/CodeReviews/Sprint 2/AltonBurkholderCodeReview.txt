Comments:
	The code isn't commented which is kind of... irritating. It just makes things harder to understand for the outsider.
	Some magic numbers show up here and there. I don't really know what "3" means in this context. Why was it chosen?
	The code does seem fairly intuitive with it's logic. Clever implementation. 
Suggestions:
	Comment the code. Explain what the functions calls are doing and what each variable is used for.
	Try to reduce the number of magic numbers being used.
