Reviewing Link.cs created by Jack Italiano

General comments:
-   Only complaint in terms of readability is the lack of comments. However, with
    a quick read through of the code, I was able to collect what the method
    accomplishes.
-   In terms of code quality, this looks like a robust template to base our
    player off of. The class isn't overly reliant on other classes and has the
    right level of portability.

Specific change:
-   While a nitpick so early on, some of the link textures cause the character
    to "jump" up and down or left and right. Likely to do with different texture
    sizes.
