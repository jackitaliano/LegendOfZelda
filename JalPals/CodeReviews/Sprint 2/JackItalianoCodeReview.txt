The code is very readable because the scope of each method is limited to one
thing. However, there are multiple overloaded methods, and I don't see the use
for having them overloaded. There should only be one option in these cases.
Someone could use the no argument constructor, then the no argument draw, which
would cause a crashing error at runtime.

I suggest removing the overloaded methods to take away the possibility of the
client misusing the methods.
