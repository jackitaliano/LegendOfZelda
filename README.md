## Known Bugs
- Some enemies can exit via the door, which will prevent items from spawning since you can't kill them all
- Transitions: Link spawns too far into the room sometimes when transitioning rooms
- Can go around bomb rooms and the texture won't change if you don't bomb it
- Keys appear in Link's inventory
- Moveable blocks sometimes don't complete their transition (due to collision)

## Tips
*(for navigating game easier)*
- Use fireballs to clear until you get a bow or boomerang
- Kill enemies for the chance to drop items/hearts
- Use the bomb to open secret doors

## Unintended Functionality
*(things included for demo purposes)*
- Bow in first room will normally only be in stairs room
- Survival room (replacement for basement) is normally only accessible from stairs
